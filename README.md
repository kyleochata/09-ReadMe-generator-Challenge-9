## Description
This project is to create a professional README.md with the use of JavaScript and node.js. README.md files are part of your repositories identity and are usually the first thing other people will read before interacting with your code. It is important to spend time curating it to meet professional standards and have it display who you are as a developer. Some people will loath having to write a README file and this project aims to simplify those who want the basics completed for them. This allows them to get a majority of the set up done, such as adding in all the section titles and picking a license. All that is needed is to add screenshots, videos, and other little details to make your README.md stand out!

A good README.md can elevate a repository, no matter the project it is used in, just like how a bad README.md will lower a repository's standard even if the rest of the project is amazing.

There are many ways to write a good README file, but not including one is a quick way to turn others away from your project.
